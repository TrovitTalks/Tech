## How to submit a talk proposal

* Create a pull request in the [master branch](https://github.com/TrovitTalks/Tech/tree/master) with yourself added to the next meetup announcement.
* Wait for discussion around your proposal, and optionally adjust your proposal based on the discussion.
* One of the repo committers will merge and close your PR

## Why we do it this way

The idea is that the name of the presentation can be available forever. This adds value to it and to the employee that takes the work do it. Also if the video nor the slides can be added, well much better.

Long after the employee left Trovit, his contribution to the knowledge of the company will remain :)

Also, when one of us looks for a job in the future, being a contributor to the formation plan of the company is always a plus ;)
